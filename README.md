mental health hackathon 
May 21-23

This was a fun project put together by 4 high students. This was the first hackathon for 3 of us including myself and we put together a mock up of a mobile app to promote self care and mental health during the pandemic. This repo contains a Java GUI which is a prototype of our app. 

Java GUI prototype application 

Download and run the .bat file, or manually run Home.java (the main menu)
